# Group H_HmeansHi_VIS Project

## Visualization Data and Task Scenario (Checkpoint I)

It's well-known that the price of houses is growing rapidly in recent years and there are many second-hand houses waiting to be sold. 
In this case, we hope to provide some advice to people who want to sell their houses or buy one second-hand house by visualizing the 
housing price data in Beijing. the PPT of the introduction: [Group_H_HousePricing_VIS_Project_Checkpoint_I.pptx](http://ddl.escience.cn/f/BbLR)

There are some points I want to tell you: 

### Data

We have collected about 3000 data at present from the website [AnJuKe](http://beijing.anjuke.com/sale/?from=navigation)and each data is
a description about a house with its location, price, house type and so on. Also we are collecting the data about the house like the
nearby hospitals and schools from Baidu Map.  

### User & Task

Our project can be used to estimate the price of a house when giving the properties of the house and can provide the distribution 
condition of second-hand house in Beijing. So our user can be: 

* The target userÂ : 

 1. People who want to sell their houses: 
In fact, Most of the people don't know how much their houses worth clearly. They know the housing price depends on many factors and
have a general concept which factor is promoting. However there are too many determinants, so that they couldn't figure out the 
relationships with housing prices itself. If we can visualize the potential links between these factors and the housing prices, they 
will be able to assess the worth of their houses or forecast the housing price accurately. When they wanna sell their houses, they 
don't need to rely on real estate agent. 
 
 2. People who want to buy houses:  
Every one knows that housing prices are getting higher and higher, So the price information is essential for those who want to buy 
houses especially for those who haven't had one house. There are too many factors and too much information about housing prices to
be considered to find a suitable house. By means of visualization, we can help them find the satisfying houses and estimate the price
more efficiently. 
 
* Tasks: 

 1. Collecting the price data and mining surrounding properties of houses and show their details in the map. 
 2. Analyzing and displaying the relevant factors of housing prices by means of visualization .
 3. According to the demand, assessing and forecasting the housing price through machine learning and data mining. 
 
### Novelty

* Obtaining data through a variety of ways such as Internet worm and web API.

* Displaying factors by various means of visualization. 

* Including assessment and prediction of the house pricing. 

* According to the needs, users can easily get the information they want.
