# Group B "FantasticFour" VIS Project

## Visualization Data and Task Scenario (Checkpoint I)
Project Name: <b>Analyzing taste preference by visualizing recipes in different countries</b>

### Data:

We use Ingredients, nutrition, cooking method of recipes of different countries as our data. The data can be acquired on websites Yummly.com and Allrecipes.com using a web crawler. (Yummly.com also provides API, but not free for commercial use and it only offers limited access for academic use) Using regular expression or other HTML analysis method, we can use a csv file or database to store the data.

### User and task:
* Users: everybody (especially for people who are curious about different taste preference in different countries, and those who want to gain some insights on how to eat healthy)

* Tasks:
  * Select a certain ingredient, see which country use this ingredient most. (show the ranking of number of appearance in different countries' recipes)
  * Check out which country like salty(sweet, spicy etc) food best
  * Check out which country like to bake(fry, stew etc) food best
  * Check out which country like high protein(low protein, high fat, low fat etc) dishes

### Novelty:
* Novel data source for visualization and analysis
* Using web crawler to grab data and select data that we need
* Proper visualization of ingredients, nutrition etc, users can see taste preference of different countries clearly and draw some conclusions

### Assignment:
* 何晨: Acquire data from Yummly.com and Allrecipes.com. Presentation
* 卢旺: Design how to better visualize the data, mathematical method for dimension reduction etc
* 蔡晨沁: Visualize data via D3.js
* 白梅: Design the interaction and color design of the webpage
